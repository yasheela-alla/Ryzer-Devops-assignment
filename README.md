## Quick Start - Run Locally in VS Code

### Step 1: Open Project in VS Code
- Extract the downloaded ZIP file
- Open VS Code
- File > Open Folder > Select the extracted folder

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Open VS Code terminal (Terminal > New Terminal or Ctrl+`):

\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Run Development Server
\`\`\`bash

## Production Deployment

### Option 1: AWS S3 (Static Site - Recommended)
See **[AWS-DEPLOYMENT.md](./AWS-DEPLOYMENT.md)** for complete guide.

Quick version:
\`\`\`bash
npm run build
aws s3 sync out/ s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME --delete
\`\`\`

### Option 2: Vercel (1-Click)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Deploy - works immediately!

### Option 3: AWS Amplify (Full Next.js)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect GitHub repo to AWS Amplify
3. Amplify auto-detects Next.js and deploys

## Adding Real Database (Optional)

The `scripts/seed.sql` contains PostgreSQL schema:

\`\`\`sql
-- Run this in your database
CREATE TABLE assets (...);
CREATE TABLE transactions (...);
\`\`\`

Then update API routes to use your database connection.

## Browser Support

4. **Technical Depth** - Advanced React patterns, TypeScript, state management
5. **Attention to Detail** - Micro-interactions, hover effects, smooth transitions
6. **Developer Experience** - Clean code, comments, easy to understand and extend

## Notes for Bhargav (CTO)

This application demonstrates:

- **Full-stack proficiency** - Next.js App Router, API routes, TypeScript
- **Frontend expertise** - React hooks, state management, component architecture
- **Design skills** - Modern UI/UX, responsive design, accessibility
- **Problem-solving** - Real-time updates, portfolio calculations, search/filter

- Advanced features (staking, P2P trading, etc.)

**This is not just a demo - it's a foundation for a real product.**

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If you see "Port 3000 is in use":
\`\`\`bash
# The app will automatically try 3001, 3002, etc.
# Or kill the process:
npx kill-port 3000
\`\`\`

### Module Not Found Errors
\`\`\`bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
\`\`\`

### Build Errors
Make sure you're using Node.js 18+:
\`\`\`bash
node --version
\`\`\`

If you see Tailwind CSS errors, make sure all dependencies installed correctly:
\`\`\`bash
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer --save-dev
\`\`\`
